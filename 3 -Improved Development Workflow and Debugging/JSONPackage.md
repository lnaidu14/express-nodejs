### Basics

To initialize a package.json file, type npm init into the console and it will prompt you with some information that you have to fill in. After going through the prompts your package.json will be created.

The main section of the JSON file is the scripts section, where you can type commands which can create shortucts to run your code. On default or as a special case, **npm start** allows you to run your **index.js** or **app.js**. This is a special keyword however, if you ever wanted to use any other script command then you have to write **npm run <command_name>**.
