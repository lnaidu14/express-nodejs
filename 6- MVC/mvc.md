### Model View Controllers

Short form is **MVC**

Models are responsible for representing, managing, saving and fetching your data. It doesn't matter if you manage data in memory, files or databases. It contains data-related logic.

Views are what the user sees or the UI. Shouldn't contain too much logic.

Controller connects the model and the view. It should only make sure that the two can communicate in both directions.
